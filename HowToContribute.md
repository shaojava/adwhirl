We welcome contributions! To contribute, please follow these steps:

  * Determine the code you want to change. AdWhirl has several components:
    * [Android SDK](http://code.google.com/p/adwhirl/source/createClone?repo=sdk-android)
    * [iPhone SDK](http://code.google.com/p/adwhirl/source/createClone?repo=sdk-iphone)
    * [Web frontend](http://code.google.com/p/adwhirl/source/createClone?repo=server-website)
    * [Backend server](http://code.google.com/p/adwhirl/source/createClone?repo=server-mobile)
    * [Backup server](http://code.google.com/p/adwhirl/source/createClone?repo=server-backup)
  * Create a server-side clone of the component you want to work on, by going to the [Source tab -> Clones](http://code.google.com/p/adwhirl/source/clones) and select the repository of the component you want to work on.
  * Write your code and tests.
  * Request a code review by [filing an Issue](http://code.google.com/p/adwhirl/issues/entry?show=review&former=sourcelist) . Note the name of your server-side clone so we can find it.
