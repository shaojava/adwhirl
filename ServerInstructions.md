# Introduction #

Getting the server up and running isn't the most difficult task, but it definitely isn't trivial either.

# Details #

Before you do any of this, make sure you have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. Your two options for instructions:
  * The prettier, although less frequently updated, [PDF](http://adwhirl.com/pdf/AdWhirl_OpenSourceServer_Setup_Instructions.pdf)
  * The up-to-date and accurate text README in the [repository](http://code.google.com/p/adwhirl/source/browse/README?repo=servers-mobile)

The instructions refer to a prebuilt AMI. The details for the latest version are below:
  * AMI ID: ami-ca54bea3
  * Manifest: adwhirl-ami/image.manifest.xml
