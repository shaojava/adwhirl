## Introduction ##
Use the AdWhirl technology to display ads from different ad networks in your Android and iPhone applications. Switch ad networks on the fly, all for free. With the source code available, you can see how it all works.

## What You Can Find ##
You'll find the SDK code to display ads from different ad networks in your mobile application. You may also find the AdWhirl server code and the web site code.

[Download](http://code.google.com/p/adwhirl/downloads/list) the latest SDK. Read the SDK integration instructions [here](SDKInstructions.md).

If you wish to run your own server instance on [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/), you can find the instructions on setting up your own instance [here](ServerInstructions.md).

We have a [Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/adwhirl-users) for users of the SDK and the server code.

Track and file all issues in the [Issues page](http://code.google.com/p/adwhirl/issues/list).

AdWhirl code uses [TouchJSON form TouchCode](https://github.com/TouchCode/TouchJSON), [Google Toolbox for Mac](http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/), [OCMock](http://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/software/OCMock/) and are supplied under different licenses. Even though this code mediates between different ad networks, no ad network SDK code is distributed here.
